My ultimate goal? To step into game development and combine my passion for coding with the creativity of gaming.`;

export const ABOUT_TEXT = `I'm originally from Brazil and now making my way in the US. I'm diving deep into the world of coding, and for me, it's fascinating to see the world through a developer's eyes, understanding the magic behind what users experience. I love learning the intricate details of programming languages. When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me playing video games, especially RPGs, or watching anime. I'm really into Japanese culture and am also learning Japanese.`;
